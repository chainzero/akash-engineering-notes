# Overview

## Warning

All links to the `provider` repo are referencing to the `gpu` branch. As soon as `gpu` is merged into `main` all links need update.

This page covers setting up development environment for both [node](https://github.com/akash-network/node) and [provider](https://github.com/akash-network/provider) repositories. The provider repo elected as placeholder for all the scripts as it depends on the `node` repo.   Should you already know what this guide is all about - feel free to explore examples

### Requirements

`Go` must be installed. Both projects are keeping up-to-date with major version on development branches. Both repositories are using the latest version of the Go, however only minor that has to always match.
